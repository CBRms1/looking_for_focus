### Base Tutorials
#### How to use
You can change the study timer using the range input below the cafe and start the timer by clicking the start button.

From there, you will gradually earn points. If you are logged in to an account, the points will be saved to that account.

#### Create a new account
To create a new account, you need to click on the profile icon:

A window will open. You can then click on _Register_ to create an account.

There are some rules for creating a new account:
- The username must contain between 3 and 25 characters
- The password must contain between 5 and 30 characters
- If a user with the specified username already exists (already exists message), you need to change the username
- You need to confirm your password by typing the same password in the confirm password field

If the user has been created, a welcome message will be displayed. Then, you can log in.

#### Sign in to your account
The login form can be found in the profile window when you click on _Login_.

When you log in, all the points you earn while studying will be saved to your account, preserving all your progress.
